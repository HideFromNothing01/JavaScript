MLB report about Shohei Otani

DENVER -- Coming into the last game of the regular season,
Shohei Ohtani had already secured the best offensive season in Dodgers history 
,and one of the most dominant the sport has ever seen.

One thing that could have taken Ohtani’s historic season to another level was 
securing MLB’s first Triple Crown since Miguel Cabrera accomplished it in 2012.
Ohtani came into Sunday’s finale only four percentage points 
behind the Padres’ Luis Arraez in batting average.
